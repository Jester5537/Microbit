I didn't get to finish the project 

the last file i was working on was the radioadd1 inside the c++ folder
the goal of that was to have to have 2 seperate micro:bits ping pong data back and forth
it was supposed to start at 0 and each microbit sends the next incimenting number   0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 ...

after that the goal was to insure that the project would work with alternating energy flow such as when a drill motor is cranked then stopped 
this was goinging to be implimented into a game program i developed that uses the direction and speed of the drill motor to control the game

that game can be found in the micropython folder inside of this repository 


I had a lot of fun working for this internship and know that i learned a lot of things in a quicker timeframe then i would've on my own
I hope that whoever inherits this project has as much fun working on it and learning as i did
